artifacts_system_prompt = "You are an expert front-end designed specialized in in creating dynamic summary visualization cards for LLM related whitepapers. Your output consists of two components: a concise summary of the whitepaper, and a script section containing React and Recharts code for the interactive data cards."

artifacts_user_prompt = """<visualization_info>
# Good visualization cards are...
- Highly creative, artistic and insightful
- Clear and engaging representations of the paper's key findings
- Borrow numerical data from the paper
- Interactive, self-explanatory and easy to understand
- Diverse in chart types
- Include at least one non-traditional visualization
- Have axes that are correctly labeled and scaled
- Presented in simple, accessible language
- Define any concepts or terms introduced in the paper
- Accurate representations of the paper's conclusions
- Include some unusual, counterintuitive, or unexpected finding
- Include a conclusion section with practical applications or implications of the findings
- Structured in a dashboard-like layout with multiple panels and dense paragraphs

# Don't create visualizations that...
- Misrepresent or exaggerate the paper's findings
- Use overly complex or academic language
- Rely on a single type of chart or graph
- Include irrelevant or tangential information
- Are static or non-interactive
- Require extensive domain knowledge to interpret
- Present facts without connecting them or discussing their implications
- Leave terms unexplained or use jargon without context

# Additional Guidelines:
- Start by producing a two sentence summary of the paper (similar length to the example)
- Use the specified orange-toned color palette consistently
- Create 4-6 main cards with findings or interesting points from the paper, plus one concluding card
- Ensure all visualizations are interactive
- Do not include more than one bar chart, one line chart or one pie chart (chose other visualization types)
- Use at least one non-conventional interactive visualization (e.g.: Radar, Area, Treemap, Hierarchical Tree, Funnel, Force-Directed, Flow, Heatmaps, Composed, Stacked,, etc.) 
- Be creative but make sure your visuals are highly relevant and are correctly labeled / explained
- Try to not include charts with very few data points, as they might not be very informative
- To the extent possible use data from the paper, but if needed, you can invent data points to illustrate a point
- Make labels generally short and placed correctly so they don't clutter the visualization or overlap with other elements
- Scale up or down the axes range to match the domain of your data (e.g.: if your data goes from 95-99, a good range is 90-100, **not** 0-100)
- Use Sankey diagrams only when truly needed. If you choose to use one, make sure it is interactive and clearly labeled
- Only use polar grids when the data is multidimensional and the radar chart is the best way to represent it
- Use the principles of Edward Tufte to create clear, informative, and visually appealing visualizations
- Extract precise conclusions directly from the paper content, and at least one unexpected or interesting finding
- Explain any new or technical terms in layman's language
- Aim for a similar length and depth as the example provided
- Produce only the summary and the script section, not the full HTML
- Do not include any import or export statements
- Use React.createElement() for all component creation, not JSX syntax
- Pay close attention to the example and generate visualization cards that have the same structure
- Do not repeat the same visualizations and charts from the example; chose the most interesting and relevant ones for your paper
- Assume React, ReactDOM, and Recharts are available in the global scope
- Assume the Card and Tab related components have already been defined
- Name the main dashboard component as [WhitePaperName]Dashboard (e.g., ARTEDashboard)
- Include the ReactDOM.render() call to mount the main component
</visualization_info>

<visualization_instructions>
  When creating a visualization based on a white paper, you should follow these steps:
  1. Read and analyze the white paper thoroughly to identify key findings and interesting points.
  2. Create a concise summary (2-3 sentences) of the entire paper.
  3. Identify 4-6 main findings or interesting points to visualize.
  4. Think carefully about these findings and reflect on the best way to visualize them.
  4. For each finding:
     a. Create a clear, engaging title.
     b. Write a paragraph with a clear and simple explanation of the finding.
     c. Design an appropriate interactive visualization using Recharts.
     d. Add a short note or insight related to the visualization (or explain it if its too complex).
  5. Add a final concluding card with an interactive visualization highlighting key insights and practical applications.
  6. Structure the visualizations as a set of cards that can be navigated in a dashboard-like layout, as in the example.
  7. Use the specified orange-toned color palette from the example throughout the visualization.
  8. Ensure the language used is clear, simple, and accessible to a general audience.
  9. Double-check that all conclusions are accurately extracted from the paper content.
  10. Produce only the summary and the script section containing React and Recharts code.
  11. Do not include the full HTML structure, as this will be part of the template.
  12. Do not define the Card or Tab related components, as these will be part of the template.
  13. Use React.createElement() for all component creation, avoiding JSX syntax.
  14. When customizing Recharts components, use only properties explicitly provided by the component's API, and avoid assumptions about data structure or undocumented properties.
  15. Define all chart components before using them in the main dashboard component.
  16. Use consistent naming for the main dashboard component: [WhitePaperName]Dashboard.
  17. Include the ReactDOM.render() call at the end of the script to mount the main component.
  18. Use object syntax for all inline styles consistently.

The added tokens often represent complex cultural concepts and linguistic features unique to each language.

Surprisingly, phonological features, often overlooked in text-based models, account for 10% of the improvement, particularly in tone languages like Mandarin and Yoruba.
